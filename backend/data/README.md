# Catalog data

`catalog.json` is a synthetic clinic catalog for the **Phase 2 context-management**
work: a scheduling agent has to navigate it reliably and cost-effectively. It is
deliberately **large** (so dumping it all into the prompt is expensive/inaccurate) and
deliberately **messy** (so naive matching fails).

Counts: ~8 locations · ~50 providers · ~82 appointment types.

## Schema

```jsonc
{
  "policies": [ "...human-readable rules a correct agent must honor..." ],

  "locations": [{
    "id", "name", "address", "city", "phone", "hours",
    "capabilities": ["imaging" | "lab" | "physical_therapy" | "dental" | "surgery"]
  }],

  "providers": [{
    "id", "name", "title",            // MD / DO / NP / PA
    "specialty",
    "location_ids": [...],            // where they practice
    "accepting_new_patients": bool,
    "languages": [...],
    "appointment_type_ids": [...]     // what they can be booked for
  }],

  "appointment_types": [{
    "id", "name", "specialty", "duration_min",
    "requires_referral": bool,
    "new_patients_allowed": bool,
    "required_capability": "imaging" | ... | (absent)
  }]
}
```

## Rules to honor (also in `policies`)

- A provider can only be booked at a location in their `location_ids`.
- A provider can only be booked for an appointment type in their `appointment_type_ids`.
- An appointment type with a `required_capability` is only bookable at a location whose
  `capabilities` include it (e.g. MRI / X-Ray / CT need `imaging`).
- `requires_referral` types need a referral on file first.
- New patients can only book `new_patients_allowed` types, and only with providers who are
  `accepting_new_patients`.

## Intentional messiness (you must handle this)

- **Duplicate provider names** — multiple `Dr. Chen` and several `Dr. Maria Garcia` across
  different specialties / locations / roles. A name alone is not a unique key.
- **Near-duplicate appointment types** — e.g. *Annual Physical* vs *Annual Wellness Visit*,
  *Skin Cancer Screening* vs *Full Body Skin Exam*, the *MRI - Brain/Spine/Knee* family.
- **Location-gated services** — only a few locations have `imaging`, so a provider may
  practice at several sites but offer an MRI at only one.
- **Multi-location providers** — "book with Dr. X" still needs a location to disambiguate.
